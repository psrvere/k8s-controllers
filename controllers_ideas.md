# Kubernetes Controllers - Problem Statements

This repository contains implementations of various Kubernetes controllers addressing real-world scenarios. Below are a few problem statements:

## 1. Pod Auto Scaler
Deployment Scaler Based on Labels: Develop a controller that watches Deployments with a specific label and scales replicas up or down based on a simple threshold, like CPU usage from metrics (using fake data). This is similar to basic auto-scaling in production web services without relying on HPA.

## 2. Deployment Scaler Based on Labels
A Kubernetes controller that automatically labels newly created Pods based on their metadata. This controller watches for Pod creation events across all namespaces (excluding system namespaces) and applies labels based on the Pod's metadata (e.g., labeling based on the app name).

## 3. ConfigMap Sync Controller
Implement a controller that watches ConfigMaps in one namespace and synchronizes their data to ConfigMaps in another namespace. Useful in real-world multi-tenant setups where configs need to be mirrored across teams or environments.

## 4. Secret Rotation Checker
Build a controller that monitors Secrets and checks their age; if older than a threshold, it triggers an event or updates an annotation to alert for rotation. This addresses real-world security practices in handling credentials for databases or APIs.

## 5. Service Endpoint Validator
Create a controller that watches Services and validates their endpoints, ensuring they point to valid Pods; if not, it adds a status condition or logs errors. Relates to real-world service discovery reliability in microservices architectures.

## 6. Job Completion Handler
Develop a controller that watches Jobs and, upon completion, creates a new ConfigMap with logs or results, then deletes the Job. This is practical for real-world batch processing workflows, like data ETL jobs in analytics platforms.

## 7. Node Resource Balancer
Implement a controller that monitors Nodes and Pods, then reschedules Pods from overloaded Nodes to underutilized ones using eviction (with safeguards). Mirrors real-world cluster optimization in cloud cost management.

## 8. Ingress Route Auditor with Leader Election
Build a controller that audits Ingress resources for duplicate routes across namespaces, using leader election to ensure only one instance runs. This handles real-world traffic routing conflicts in large-scale API gateways.
